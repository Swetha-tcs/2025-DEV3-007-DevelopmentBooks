# 📚 Software Development Books 

This is a **Spring Boot** application that calculates the total price for a basket of software development books. The pricing logic applies discounts for combinations of *different* book titles. The application is built using **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** principles and includes:

- ✅ **RESTful API for programmatic access**
- ✅ **Static HTML and JavaScript-based user interface**
- ✅ **Comprehensive unit and integration testing**
- ✅ **Clean, modular architecture with a testable service layer**

## 🔍 Problem Overview

There are 5 different software development books available:

1. Clean Code  
2. The Clean Coder  
3. Clean Architecture  
4. Test-Driven Development by Example  
5. Working Effectively with Legacy Code

💰 **Base Price per Book**: €50, with the following discounts applied when purchasing different titles together:

| Unique Titles in Set | Discount   |
|----------------------|------------|
| 1                    | 0%         |
| 2                    | 5%         |
| 3                    | 10%        |
| 4                    | 20%        |
| 5                    | 25%        |

The challenge is to **minimize the total price** for any basket of books by optimally grouping them to take advantage of the best possible discounts.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development & Running the Application

This project was developed using TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles:

      1. Write a failing unit test

      2. Implement just enough code to make it pass

      3. Refactor with confidence

▶️ **How to Run**
From your IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code):

✅ **Run Unit Tests to verify pricing logic:**
Locate PricingServiceTest.java → Right-click → Run

🚀 **Start the Application:**
Locate SoftwareBooksApplication.java → Right-click → Run

🌐 **Access the Web App:**
Open your browser and go to → [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

 ### 💡 Example

``` **Input:**
- 2× Clean Code  
- 2× The Clean Coder  
- 2× Clean Architecture  
- 1× Test-Driven Development by Example  
- 1× Working Effectively with Legacy Code  

**Optimal Grouping:**  
→ 2 sets of 4 different books (20% discount each)

**Calculation:**  
     2 × (4 × €50 × 0.80) = **€320.00**
 ```
